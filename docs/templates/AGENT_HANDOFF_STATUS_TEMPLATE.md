## 🚧 Pending Tasks

### High Priority (Do Next)
1. **[Task Name]** - [Why it's important]
   - Context: [What's needed to complete]
   - Blocker: [If any]
   - Next step: [Specific action]

---

## 🧠 Critical Context

### Important Decisions Made
1. **[Decision]** - [Rationale]
   - Example: "Used optional parameters instead of new function to avoid code duplication"
   
2. **[Architecture Choice]** - [Why this approach]
   - Example: "Implemented caching at analyzer level, not extractor level, because..."

### Patterns Established
- **Caching**: All tools use 24-hour cache with `--force` override
- **Output**: Dual format (JSON + Markdown) for all analyzers
- **Naming**: `analyze[Feature]` for analyzers, `extract[Data]` for extractors

### Gotchas Discovered
- **[Issue]** - [What to watch out for]
  - Example: "Puppeteer screenshots must wait for networkidle0, not just load event"
  
- **[Edge Case]** - [How to handle]
  - Example: "Some sites block headless browsers - use headless: 'new' not true"

### Real-World Examples Referenced
- **dental-static project** - Mobile menu at 767px, negative margins discovered
- **e-commerce-site project** - Font-family embedding weights in filename

## 🔄 Exact Resume Commands

### Verify Current State
```bash
# Check git status
git status

# Verify Node.js version
node --version

# Check current toolkit version
node -e "console.log(require('./package.json').version)"

# List uncommitted changes
git diff --name-only
```

### Next Steps to Execute
```bash
# 1. Review uncommitted changes
git diff .github/copilot-instructions.md

# 2. Test new tool
npm run analyze:feature -- https://example.com

# 3. If tests pass, commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add [feature] - implements [what]"

# 4. Continue with next pending task
# [Specific command or action]
```

### Files to Review Before Continuing
1. `docs/DOCUMENTATION_MAINTENANCE_PROTOCOL.md` - Review documentation standards
2. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Understand current patterns
3. `CHANGELOG.md` - See what's in unreleased section

## 💡 Lessons Learned This Session

### What Worked Well
1. **[Success]** - [What to repeat]
   - Example: "Testing tools on multiple sites before documenting caught edge cases early"

2. **[Effective Pattern]** - [Why it was good]
   - Example: "Creating guide alongside implementation prevented documentation debt"

### What to Improve
1. **[Challenge]** - [How to do better next time]
   - Example: "Should have checked existing tools more carefully before creating new one"

2. **[Inefficiency]** - [Optimization idea]
   - Example: "Spent time on manual testing that could be automated with test scripts"

### Recommendations for Next Agent
- [Specific advice based on this session's experience]
- [Patterns to follow or avoid]
